# Extend5Solvers
Set of Open Source PDE Solvers written for FOAM-Extend 5.0 CFD Code

Segregated solvers include Acoustic an Acoustic Solver, An Acoustic Solver with Damping and a solver for Maxwell's Equations of Electrodynamics.
Block-Coupled Solvers include solvers for Maxwell's equatioin in multiple media. At this point in time a constant permittivity is assumed, materials
  with non-constant permittivity should be modeled by using multiple layers in which the permittivity varies slowly from one layer to the next
